# Facial-Recognition-
(Deep Learning, CNN, Pytorch)

Due to the COVID-19 coronavirus, masked face recognition poses a challenge at public places, while removing face mask will increase the risk of novel virus infection.
In this facial recognition task, we will use CNN model and SVM to recognize masked faces with higher accuracy. 
First, we trained a CNN model to generate an embedding of features of an image. 
Then, we focus on a dataset which helps in building classifier for masked faces.
In the end, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification.
